The purpose of this program was to take inputs of "Big Integers" which are outside of the scope of an integer in the java programming language and represent them as individual
digits stored in a linked list as to not exceed the storage restrictions. The first method was used to parse the big integer and create the linked list. The next methods were
add, subtract, and multiply.
